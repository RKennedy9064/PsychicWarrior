/// <summary>
/// Enhanced Mind Blade pool: the ability toggles use the game's <see cref="ActivatableAbilityResourceLogic"/>
/// against a custom pool resource, which gives the shaman-style "remaining points on the icon" display and
/// auto-darkening for free. Two gaps in the stock logic are patched here:
///
/// 1. <c>CalcResourceCost</c> spends a flat 1 per toggle (it has no weight field). We override it to charge
///    the ability's real +N cost (1/2/4) so a +2 burst reserves 2 points, etc.
/// 2. <c>IsAvailable</c> only requires ≥1 point, so a +2 toggle could be switched on with a single point left
///    (and then under-spend / not spend). We require the full cost so weighted toggles darken correctly.
///
/// Both are scoped to our toggles via <see cref="MindBladeEnchantments.AbilityToggleCosts"/>; every other
/// activatable ability is untouched.
///
/// IMPORTANT: <c>IsAvailable</c> is polled by the action-bar UI when no component runtime context is active,
/// so the context-bound <c>__instance.Fact</c>/<c>Owner</c> accessors throw "ComponentRuntime is unavailable"
/// there — a throwing postfix makes the game treat the toggle as permanently unavailable. We therefore read
/// identity/owner from the <c>EntityFactComponent runtime</c> argument (direct references, context-free) and
/// wrap everything in try/catch so the patch can never disable an ability.
